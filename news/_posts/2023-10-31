On October 31, 2023, I received the Hwang Gyu-Young Outstanding Researcher Award.
This award is funded by Professor Hwang Gyu-Young and is operated by DGIST to recognize outstanding research achievements in the field of information and communication.
It is awarded to students affiliated with the Electronic Engineering & Computer Sciences (EECS) who have achieved great research results.
